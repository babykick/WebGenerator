The main frame is a divided into three areas: top, content and right side area.
<ul> 
<li>Top: includes Header, navigation bar and the website title</li>
<li>Content: The main content of the site, including text, graphics or animations.</li>
<li>Right side: could be used to show additional information or explanation.</li>
<li>Footer: powered and copyright information</li>
</ul>
This style of frame is easy to provide informations about each aspect.
The whole color scheme I choose is a gray dark style which seems quiet and comfortable to eyes.
Text font and color for the content is adjusted in CSS to give a proper size for navigation.
