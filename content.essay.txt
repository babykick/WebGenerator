2.1 Children use internet intent(Must five-year-olds be trained on computers today to get the high-paying jobs of tomorrow?)
Most children and teenage are surfing on the internet to search exciting things, such as games, interesting pictures and videos even sex materials. Internet is like a Pandora's Box to them which open a door to see the world. But unlike adults, children don't know what they what in most cases, they just feel interesting and play on the internet. They are not aware of the harmness of internet content . 
School education encourages children to use internet to search the related materials about they learn. The main reason is that this can extend the range of learning, improve the ability of students to research by themselves. It's the positive side of internet to everybody. But to children,  case is different.
Children have not enough ability to collect the information which is effective....
Children are easily attracted by other things.
These factors 

2.2 low-age children use adult features of internet
Must five-year-olds be trained on computers today to get the high-paying jobs of tomorrow?

2.3 Rating system for internet(Do computers really "connect" children to the world?)
Should the content on the internet be filtered like Google's safe search or just depend on the parents' supervision? I think a proper rating system is necessary but it can not play its role well on the open 
internet environment. The internet can not force you to show your ID card like movie theater and give you a ticket then let you go. Everything is open. Although the search engine can process the search results by it default setting, the authorizaion is still the same. Because anonymity is a persistent part of internet which insists the freedom of information flowing and information protection for internet users. No one knows you're a dog (refer to the dog source).

The internet guide for children is like sexual education.It's finally solved by enhance understanding.So it a paradox for children because they don't have the ability to know these. Guardians can only reduce the time of children to use internet and restrict the usage of internet by installing some content guard softwares. These methods are tecnical and maybe works for only some chilren who don't know much about computers.
